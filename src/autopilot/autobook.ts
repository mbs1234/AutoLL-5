 * one booking and one move per attraction per session.
 *

 *
 * Two different questions are asked here and they are keyed differently on

 *
 * - **Per reservation, per date** is whether the party holds a pass for an
 *   attraction on a date. That is one fact, it comes from one
 *   `findExistingLL(plans, id, date)` lookup, and it is an *input*: it arrives
 *   as `stillHeld` on each `resolveHeld` call and is not stored. `settleableIds`
 *   yields one entry per attraction precisely because one lookup answers it for
 *   every lock on that attraction and date.
 * - **Per lock** is everything accumulated in order to give an action back:
 *   `confirmed`, `absences` and `unresolved`. A release hands back one action,
 *   and the only evidence that can justify that is evidence gathered *after
 *   that action's request went out*. Keyed per reservation-per-day instead,
 *   a `modify`-era observation certifies a `book` lock taken later on the same
 *   attraction and date -- so the booking whose response was lost is released
 *   on evidence from before it was sent, and the attraction is booked twice.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by counting absences per lock rather than per reservation:
 * `resolveHeld` runs once per attraction per poll, so each live lock's counter
 * advances at most once per poll either way.

   * release its lock. It stayed in the shared copy, and the next pass for that

   *
   * The answer says what that poll would have said: the reservation exists,
   * now. It counts for this one lock and nothing else. The cost is a lock
   * released early should plans miss the moved pass twice running, and that
   * buys at most one more move, to a better time. `book` and `swap` must not be

   * release can spend a second entitlement on the same attraction.

  /**
   * Settle every action lock on one attraction against observed plans.

   * only hard rule is that it can be *redeemed* once per day. A permanent
   * attempt lock is therefore stricter than the rules require, and costs a
   * genuine opportunity: cancel a late return time by hand and the earlier one
   * that drops an hour later would never be taken.
   *
   * So the lock is released by evidence rather than held for the session:
   *
   * - `stillHeld` -- the reservation exists. Keep the lock (a second booking
   *   would be rejected anyway), and if the attempt was still in doubt, count it
   *   as booked now, since `markBooked` never ran.
   * - `!stillHeld` -- nothing is held, so the attempt either failed or has been
   *   cancelled since. Both make rebooking legal.
   *
   * Two conditions gate a release, and both are needed:
   *
   * 1. The reservation must have been **seen held at least once**. For a
   *    booking never observed, absence cannot distinguish "it failed" from "the
   *    itinerary has not caught up", and acting on the latter rebooks something
   *    already held. An attempt that never confirms therefore keeps its lock for
   *    the session -- the conservative pre-existing behaviour, and no real loss:
   *    either it is held, making `modify` the useful action anyway, or it truly
   *    failed and next session retries it.
   * 2. Absence must then be seen `CONFIRM_ABSENT_POLLS` times running, so a
   *    single flaky itinerary response cannot release a live reservation.
   *
   * Poll count rather than elapsed time is deliberate but worth knowing. Plans
   * are fetched every tenth poll tick, so they are ~7.5 minutes apart at the
   * idle cadence and ~12 seconds apart in a drop burst; the two absences a
   * release needs therefore take ~15 minutes idle and ~24 seconds mid-drop. A
   * cancellation is noticed far faster during a drop, which is when it matters,
   * and condition 1 is what makes that 37x compression safe.
   *
   * `spent` closes the third case: an entitlement that has been redeemed, or
   * has expired unredeemed, is gone rather than cancelled. Eligibility usually
   * stops a rebooking attempt first, but not always -- and the lock is the
   * cheaper place to be certain.
   *
   * All three kinds are swept together, because the *observation* is one fact
   * about the reservation. Each lock is then judged on its own, against the
   * evidence gathered since it was taken, because a release hands back one
   * action:
   *
   * - For `modify` the reservation demonstrably existed when the lock was taken
   *   -- the provider only chooses that kind having found one -- so Disney's
   *   answer to the move confirms it (`markMoved`), or failing that the next
   *   poll does, and the lock then releases only once the reservation is
   *   genuinely gone, at which point there is nothing left to move.
   * - For `swap` the gained attraction was *not* held when the lock was taken,
   *   so absence cannot tell a failed swap from one that succeeded and was
   *   cancelled from an itinerary that has not caught up -- which is `book`'s
   *   situation exactly, and condition 1 handles it the same way.
   *
   * What it must not do is let one lock's evidence settle another's. A `modify`
   * lock confirmed at 10:00 is not a statement about a `book` request sent at
   * 10:15 whose response was lost; treating it as one releases the doubt-hold
   * on evidence from before the booking existed, and the attraction is booked a
   * second time. Hence `confirmed`/`absences` per lock -- see the class note.
