 *   empty `guests` array. Counting it means that after the first tap-in of the
 *   day autopilot believes the party is full and swaps away a reservation it
 *   never needed to give up, rather than booking into the slot that just came
 *   free.
 * - **Not cancellable.** The same signal `LLTracker` already treats as "this
 *   still occupies a slot"; the two paths disagreeing about what held means is
 *   how the bug above went unnoticed.
 * - **Multiple Experiences Pass.** A replacement entitlement rather than one
 *   of the three selections. A guard at the boundary rather than a live fix:
 *   Disney converts a pass by changing its kind, so `isLLMP` above already
 *   rejects every such pass the parser can currently produce. It stays because
 *   this is where arbitrary plans enter, and because getting it wrong costs a
 *   real reservation to a needless swap.
