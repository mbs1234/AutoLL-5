 * the same second with the same outcome would be one event reported twice.
 *
 * A *failure* is keyed differently, and has to be: `addLogEntry` collapses a
 * repeat of the failure already at the top into one row carrying a count and
 * **the time of the most recent occurrence**. With the time in the key, every
 * rewrite of that row looked like a new event, so the merge below kept the
 * stored copy as well and appended it back. In burst cadence that turned the
 * twenty stored rows into twenty copies of one error inside half a minute, and
 * the day's real bookings were gone.
 *
 * So a failure is keyed by exactly what `addLogEntry` collapses on -- name,
 * status and detail, with no time -- which keeps the two rules in agreement:
 * whatever the log would fold into one row, the merge treats as one row. Two
 * genuine failures are still told apart by attraction and by detail, which is
 * the same resolution the on-screen log offers.
 *
 * The cost is that when both providers have hit the same failure on the same
 * attraction, the two rows become one. Summing the counts is not available: a
 * provider rewrites its own row as the count climbs, so adding the stored value
 * would compound its own earlier writes. What the merge does instead is keep
 * the *larger* count and the *later* time of the two, so a slower writer can
 * neither wind a count backwards nor make a burst look older than it is. That
 * understates two concurrent bursts rather than misreporting one, which is the
 * right direction to be wrong in.

 * `${bookingDate}:${kind}:${experienceId}`, and the date inside one is the
 * ledger's business rather than this file's. That is what let the key gain a
 * date without a storage migration -- the stored string is the identity, and
 * rewriting one on the way in would desync the owner-scoped removal below.
 *
 * Note the two dates are different dates. This store is scoped to the *park*
 * day, as the commits are; the date inside a key is the day the reservation
 * would be *for*. On a booking morning one day's bucket holds keys for every
 * park day being booked, which is the point.
 *
 * Day-scoped, like the commits. Written as the union of what is already stored
 * and what this instance holds, so a lock another instance took is never lost
 * to a slower write from this one.
 *
 * `remove` is what makes that union releasable. Adding is safe to infer -- a
 * key present in either copy is a lock somebody holds -- but a release cannot
 * be, because absence from `keys` is indistinguishable from an instance that
 * simply never held it. Without an explicit list the write was add-only, so
 * every release was undone by the next mount reading the day's locks back:
 * cancel a Lightning Lane by hand and autopilot would refuse to rebook that
 * attraction for the rest of the park day. Only the instance that took a lock
 * passes it here -- see `AutoBookLedger.ownedKeys`.
 *
 * Each key carries the id of the instance holding it, and **a release only
 * takes effect for the holder**. Without that, one instance could withdraw a
 * lock another instance was relying on: a foreground search that adopted a
 * lock from the day's copy and later gave it back was removing somebody else's
 * protection, not its own.
 *
 * Not atomic, and localStorage offers no way to make it so -- two instances can
 * still interleave a read and a write and lose one update. It is instead
 * self-healing: every holder republishes what it owns on each poll, so a lost
 * key is back within a tick rather than gone for the day. The separate
