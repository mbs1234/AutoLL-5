/**
 * Exclusive, expiring leases on one mutation's conflict set.
 *
 * Separate from the ledger's attempt locks, and the separation is the point.
 * An attempt lock answers "has this instance already done action K to
 * attraction X today" -- anti-thrash, session-scoped, shared as a union, and
 * never given back for a modify. A lease answers a different question: "is
 * anybody acting *right now* on an attraction or reservation this mutation
 * could affect?" Conflating the two is what made a foreground search defer to
 * a marker for something that finished at 9am, and then, once that was
 * narrowed, made one provider able to take over another's live operation.
 *
 * Three properties the attempt locks cannot offer:
 *
 * - **Exclusive.** Acquisition of the whole conflict set is serialised through
 *   the Web Locks API where the browser has it, so two instances cannot both
 *   believe they won. Read `available()` before relying on that; where it is
 *   missing this degrades to an unsynchronised read-modify-write, which is the
 *   old behaviour and is reported rather than hidden.
 * - **Expiring.** A tab that is closed mid-request leaves its lease behind, and
 *   nothing will ever come back to release it. A lease older than
 *   `LEASE_TTL_MS` is therefore free to take. Holders renew while they work --
 *   see `keepAlive`, which is what makes "while they work" mean the length of
 *   the request rather than the length of the tick that started it.
 * - **Owned by an instance, not a tab.** Two providers live in one tab -- NextLL
 *   nests one inside the app's own -- so a tab-scoped identity would let them
 *   take over each other. A reload is not a safe inheritance either: the old
 *   script is gone, but its request may have reached Disney and merely lost the
 *   response. Expiry is the only safe way to reclaim a dead instance's work.

 * request that times out may have moved the reservation; until fresh plans say
 * otherwise, *nothing* may touch it -- and "until fresh plans say otherwise" is
 * not a duration, so it cannot be a TTL.
 *
 * Releasing the lease on a status-0 and trusting the ledger's attempt lock was
 * the first mistake here. That lock is keyed `<kind>:<attraction>`, a foreground
 * search does not consult it at all, and a swap for a *different* incoming
 * attraction can target the very reservation left in doubt.
 *
 * Clearing it because enough time or contrary reads passed was the second
 * mistake. Those are not proof that Disney did not apply a request whose
 * response was lost. A doubt now clears only on the exact state requested, a
 * definitive late response, or an explicit confirmation from the person who
 * checked Disney's Plans.
 *
 * A booking is the deliberate exception, because Disney itself refuses the
 * repeat that the rule above exists to prevent: a booking resent when the
 * first one did land is refused, since a guest holds each attraction once a
 * day. So for `book` a plans read started long enough after the request
 * settles the doubt either way (`SETTLE_AFTER_MS`); if the first one lands
 * late after all, one of the two is refused. Holding it until a person
 * cleared it froze the attraction for the rest of the day, often after the
 * booking had in fact landed.
 *
 * A cancellation is not an exception, although Disney refuses one resent. A
 * cancellation that lands late does not wait for a repeat: it removes the
 * pass as it stands then, after a move the cleared protection let through as
 * readily as before it. So a cancellation clears only when Plans no longer
 * show the passes it was for, like a move on its exact result.
