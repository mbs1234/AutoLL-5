/**
 * A section that starts folded away.
 *
 * For the reference material on a long screen -- what was learned, what
 * happened -- which is worth keeping and not worth scrolling past to reach
 * the controls underneath.
 *
 * Native `<details>`, so it needs no state, no JavaScript and no library:
 * the browser handles the toggle, keyboard access and the open/closed
 * semantics that a screen reader announces. `count` is rendered beside the
 * title so a folded section still says how much is inside.
