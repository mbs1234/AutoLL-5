 * The "user beware" note beside a Start button, after Disney pushed back.

 * Starting again is allowed -- the owner's rule is a warning, not a lock-out
 * -- so this says what the risk is and leaves the button alone. It lasts half
 * an hour from the last pushback, whichever routine met it.
 *
 * A note and not a confirmation step on purpose: turning Autopilot on has to
 * happen inside the tap that asks for it, and a step in between would break
 * the sound and the wake lock on an iPhone.
