 * be kept in step for two builds to stay out of each other's stored state.
 *
 * The `as const` on this and on the notification namespace is load-bearing.
 * Both feed the template literal types below and `storageKey`'s return type,
 * and a template literal expression without it widens to `string` -- which
 * would quietly turn `StorageKey`, `NotificationTag` and every namespaced key
 * in the repo into plain `string` with nothing failing to say so.
